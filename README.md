# html.resume
This is a capstone project of my resume. 
It was built using HTML codes only.
It will allow sharing your resume using a short link.
In addition, editing the link will also reflect wherever the link is sent to.
Such a great way for RESUME submission for job applications, interviews, and appraisers.
